# Batch-Render-Tool
A tool to batch render models in a directory

#Instructions
Script pulls from set directories, so if you move it from the current directory, the directory locations will have to be updated.  
Drag batchRender into an open 3ds max
Set the directory where you want to pull the max files.  In this case the directory is:  M:\LIBRARY\Scripts\Render_Batch\BatchProps.
Renders will automatically save to:  M:\LIBRARY\Scripts\Render_Batch\BatchRenders
And that is about it, barring any errors.
